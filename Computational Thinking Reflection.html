            <p><b>1. The Extent the Skills Are Covered</b></p>
            <p>There are 10 computational thinking skills mentioned in Tauno Palts and Margus Pedaste's article: problem
                formulation, abstraction, problem reformulation, decomposition, data collection and analysis,
                algorithmic design, parallelization and iteration, automation, generalization, testing and evaluation.
            </p>
            <p>This module covers most of core skills of the article. It highlights four key techniques, including
                decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, and algorithms. Firstly, it decomposes several common
                tasks such as planning a holiday and cleaning house into small problems. Secondly, they are simplified
                into a few actions, and this process is called abstraction. Then, although pattern recognition is not
                emphasized by the article, it is associated with abstraction. It can also help us in problem formulation
                and reformulation. We discusses various patterns to solve these problems, and then changes them into
                algorithms. In the end, we evaluates which pattern is better. The process of iteration, automation,
                generalization, and testing can all be found when we uses functions to solve problems. For example,
                loops are useful for repeat tasks, which iterates solutions and reduces the need of manual operations.
                And we can reuse the functions or strategies we've created when solving similar problems. This is
                generalization.</p>
            <p>However, as for data collection and analysis not mentioned in the previous paragraph, the module doesn't
                talk too much. I think the reason is that it's so necessary that it requires no further discussion.
                Besides, data collection and analysis isn't our main work if we are programmers. </p>

            <p><b>2. More Details Should be Addressed</b></p>
            <p>In my opinion, decomposition and algorithmic design should be addressed in more detail. Converting
                natural language to a language that can be executed by an agent (i.e. a programming language) is the
                most significant task in CT, and decomposition as well as algorithms require the most effort in order to
                reach a conversion. They are also very necessary. Even abstraction can be omitted, which means we can
                still solve the problems putting all the details or problems into algorithms though it takes much time
                and space. But we can't do that without breaking down huge problems and just let the computer solve
                generic problems without pointing out different steps. Moreover, a function can only solve several
                simple problems, and a complex program is usually composed of many functions. There is no doubt that we
                need decomposition before creating algorithms. When it comes to algorithmic design, though coding is not
                all we need to learn (<a
                    href="https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/do-we-really-need-computational-thinking/">Nardelli, 2019</a>),
                it is still an important skill for students major in computing. It is directly associated with
                solutions.</p>
            <p>Both the article and the module use examples to demonstrate these CT skills. The article describes a
                system for reminding us to water the plants, while the module hypothesizes two scenarios — planning a
                holiday and cleaning a house. However, it is better that they can provide more examples and even data to
                present the process of decomposition and designing algorithms with a programming language, just like the
                platform “Leetcode” does. Leetcode always describes some daily problems and asks users to solve them in
                the way of algorithmic design.</p>

            <p><b>3. Comments on the Model and Skills</b></p>
            <p>The authors summarized different scholars' ideas and created a very comprehensive model. The research
                method is rigorous. They also developed a sequence for these stages and skills, which is quite logical.
                But I think it will be clearer if problem reformulation can be deleted because there are only two
                articles mentioned it. And pattern recognition should be added to defining the problem stage. The first
                stage's skills can be listed in this order: problem formulation, decomposition, abstraction, and pattern
                recognition, which is very similar with the module's techniques. After adjusting, pattern recognition is
                more visually describes the action of reorganizing the problem after abstraction and decomposition,
                which also plays a role of problem reformulation.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, people do not follow such rules at all times in practice. They might collect and analyse
                data again if they find the algorithms don't reach the goal. Sometimes, they generalize solution only
                when they finish testing and evaluation. They should make sure the algorithms they created is the most
                efficient first. If the algorithms are not perfect enough, they may raise new problems based on previous
                algorithms instead of trying to generalizing solution.</p>
