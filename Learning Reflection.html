        <p class="lrtexts">From my point of view, computing fundamentals are one of the most interesting parts of
            the module. The examples of holiday planning and house cleaning were easy to understand, which offered
            me a good chance to know CT skills. Now I can use them to solve algorithmic problems and daily problems.
            In addition, I learned a lot of basic functions from this part, and the coding problems were quite
            appropriately challenging. They often captured my interest in learning, making the lessons not boring at
            all.
            <br><br>
            Another interesting part is the discussion of ChatGPT. ChatGPT has become the most popular chatbot
            around the world at the moment, and the trend is to use it to assist our work and study. The question is
            how to use it without causing academic misconduct and to evaluate the result it generated, which is
            definitely something that schools can tell their students. I was very glad that Dr. Daniela Tsaneva let
            us try to build websites with ChatGPT. It was an unforgettable experience and I found both the cons and
            pros of ChatGPT on building websites. Though it could help us create a simple website structure and
            debug, the websites it generated were still far from being aesthetically pleasing to human design. They
            were also not sophisticated enough to meet our needs. This part gave me a critical perspective on the
            use of AI.

        <p class="lrtexts">It was a pity that we didn't gain much knowledge of website creation, especially CSS
            layout, so that I had to learn it from the internet. But it was not a problem because we learned a lot
            of tags and CSS properties from the module, and self-learning was a habit we must form. </p>

        <p class="sub-topic"><b>The impact on my future learning and career</b></p>
        <p class="lrtexts">Having finished the module, I'm finally sure that I prefer back-end work. When I was in
            high school, I was not able to catch up with math due to the fast pace of school, and then had to study
            arts at the university. Actually, I was so obsessed with the feeling of accomplishment that came from
            solving math problems. The module woke my love of science up, and now I have a perfect opportunity and
            enough time to enjoy it.
            <br><br>
            The front-end is a bit tedious for me though building a beautiful website also makes me happy, while
            solving back-end problems is more like an adventure with suspense. And I'm grateful for all the teachers
            in this module!
