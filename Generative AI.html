            <p>Hi GPT, please create a short biography of Joy Buolamwini, a computer scientist focusing on
                algorithmic bias. The biography is not longer than 300 words. It must have three parts. The first
                part contains biographical facts, the second part introduces her main achivements, and the last part
                discusses their relevance for modern computer science. Thank you!</p>

            <p><b>Joy Buolamwini: A Brief Biography</b>
                <br><br>
                <b>Biographical Background</b>
                <br>
                Joy Buolamwini is an accomplished computer scientist, researcher, and digital activist born in Edmonton,
                Canada, and raised in Mississippi, USA. She pursued her undergraduate studies in Computer Science at
                Georgia Tech and later completed her master's degree as a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford.
                She then joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she earned an M.S. in Media Arts
                and Sciences. Her background in technology and ethics has strongly influenced her work, specifically
                focusing on the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) in society.
                <br><br>
                <b>Key Achievements</b>
                <br>
                Buolamwini founded the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL), an organization dedicated to addressing bias
                and promoting accountability in AI. Her research at MIT revealed significant racial and gender biases in
                popular facial recognition technologies, showing that these systems often fail to accurately identify
                people of color, especially women. Her findings, presented in her groundbreaking study “Gender Shades,”
                sparked widespread discussion about algorithmic bias, leading to responses from major companies like
                IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon, which have since reevaluated or paused their facial recognition programs. In
                2020, she testified before the U.S. Congress on the dangers of unchecked AI, helping to shape emerging
                policies.
                <br><br>
                <b>Impact on Computer Science</b>
                <br>
                Buolamwini's work has been instrumental in raising awareness about the ethical challenges posed by AI
                and has set a precedent for transparency and accountability in the tech industry. Her research and
                advocacy emphasize the importance of inclusive datasets and rigorous evaluation processes to ensure AI
                systems are fair and unbiased. Her influence has inspired new policies and industry standards, making
                algorithmic justice a central concern in modern computer science. Today, her work continues to shape the
                discourse around ethical AI, reinforcing the need for diverse perspectives in technology development to
                create a more equitable digital future.

            <p>Thank you so much. Now could you give me the sources for what you've claimed: 1. Buolamwini founded
                the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL). 2. She published her study "Gender Shades". 3. She testified
                before the U.S. Congress.</p>

            <p> Here are the sources for the claims regarding Joy Buolamwini's work:
                <br><br>
                1. <b>Founding the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL)</b>: Joy Buolamwini established the Algorithmic
                Justice League to address issues of bias in artificial intelligence and to promote accountability
                and fairness in the development of AI systems. This initiative has been highlighted as a pioneering
                effort in
                advocating for more ethical and unbiased technology(<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_Justice_League">Wikipedia</a>).
                <br><br>
                2. <b>Publishing "Gender Shades"</b>: Buolamwini's study, Gender Shades, exposed significant racial
                and gender biases in facial recognition technologies by examining the performance of systems from
                major tech companies. The study found that these systems were less accurate in identifying
                darker-skinned and
                female faces, which underscored the need for improved AI accountability. This research has been
                widely referenced and played a crucial role in raising awareness about algorithmic bias(<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Buolamwini">Wikipedia</a>)(<a
                    href="https://www.poetofcode.com/about/">Poet of Code</a>).
                <br><br>
                3. <b>Testifying before the U.S. Congress</b>: Buolamwini has testified before the U.S. Congress to
                discuss the civil rights implications of AI and advocate for stricter oversight and ethical
                guidelines
                for AI development. Her congressional testimonies reflect her dedication to reducing AI harms and
                aligning technology development with societal values(<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Buolamwini">Wikipedia</a>)(<a
                    href="https://www.poetofcode.com/about/">Poet of Code</a>).

                <p>The chatbot is ChatGPT. Generally, the result of the first prompt is great, and has a nice
                    consistency and coherence. The paragraphs are also interesting, especially the second paragraph
                    mentions illustrious companies like IBM, Microsoft and Amazon's response to Buolamwini, which is
                    very impressive. </p>
                <p>In the biographical background section, it presents Buolamwini in chronological order and ends with a
                    sentence describing the impact of her academic background on her career. The second paragraph shows
                    her greatest achievements from past to present: the establishment of Algorithmic Justice League, the
                    study of facial recognition bias, and advising world leaders and executives. The last paragraph is
                    highly related to her main achievements introduced at the second paragraph, summarizing the
                    contribution of her research to modern computer science.</p>
                <p>However, ChatGPT ignored Buolamwini her highest degree is PhD at present. She made some wonderful
                    films and a documentary, which are worthy to be written in her biography as well. ChatGPT focused
                    more on her as a scientist than an artist.</p>
                <p>Moreover, it is worth noting the sources ChatGPT provided. Most of them come from Wikipedia, and some
                    of them can be found in Buolamwini's personal website. All of them are secondary sources that are
                    not so authoritative though they pass the fact-check. I prefer first sources. When it comes to the
                    founder of AJL, it is expected to refer <a href="https://www.ajl.org/about">the website of AJL</a>.
                    As for
                    Buolamwini's study, sharing <a
                        href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a.html?mod=article_inline&ref=akusion-ci-shi-dai-bizinesumedeia">the
                        link of her paper</a> is better. To prove she did testify before the U.S congress, <a
                        href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO00/20190522/109521/HHRG-116-GO00-Wstate-BuolamwiniJ-20190522.pdf">a
                        government document</a> is the most trusty.</p>
                <p>To sum up, ChatGPT did a good job in spite of lacking a deeper dive into the sources. Not only these
                    paragraphs are easy to read, but also the facts it offered are reliable. I've used ChatGPT to
                    generate texts several times before, and it even couldn't satisfy the requirement of words limit at
                    that moment. But this time it did it, maybe because it has upgraded already.</p>
